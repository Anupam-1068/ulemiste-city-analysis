## Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing the profit trends in Ülemiste City over time and identifying correlations between various variables using heatmaps. The insights derived from this analysis can help in strategic decision-making and forecasting future trends.

## Data Preparation and Cleaning

To ensure the accuracy and reliability of our analysis, we performed extensive data preparation and cleaning, including:

1. **Data Collection**: Aggregating data from relevant sources.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Addressing any missing values in the dataset.
3. **Data Formatting**: Standardizing data formats for consistency.
4. **Outlier Detection and Treatment**: Identifying and handling outliers.
5. **Normalization**: Ensuring data consistency through normalization.

## Analysis and Visualizations

### Heatmap Analysis

The heatmap visualizes the correlation between different variables, helping to identify:

- **High Correlation Pairs**: Variables with strong positive or negative correlations.
- **Patterns and Anomalies**: Key patterns and anomalies in the data.

### Time Series Analysis

The time series analysis provides insights into trends and patterns over time, including:

- **Profit Trends**: Observing the increase in profit over the analyzed period.
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Detecting recurring seasonal effects.
- **Forecasting**: Making future projections based on identified trends.

## Conclusions

The analysis highlighted key relationships and trends in the dataset, enabling more informed decision-making and strategic planning. The combination of heatmap and time series analyses provided a comprehensive understanding of the data's temporal dynamics and inter-variable correlations.
